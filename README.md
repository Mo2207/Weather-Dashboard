# Weather-Dashboard

## Description:
  
This application is a weather dashboard that displays current and future 5 day forecast for the users current location and any searched cities.
  - My motivation for this project was to create an application where I can view the weather. 
  - I built this application to get better at accessing and using data from api's.
  - Building this project I learned how to more thoroughly read through documentation and use it to problem solve.
